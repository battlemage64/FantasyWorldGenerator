A small star, approximately 1 AU away. A ball of debris slowly grow larger and eventually forms into a planet.

Continents form, weather patterns form, all that great stuff.

A chance meeting of molecules forms the first amino acid.

An even more chance meeting forms the first eukaryote.

Before long, life is born.

--------------------

The first humans evolve on continent Ogbqur around 11 million DV. They survive by hunting the herds of elephant.

8.5 million BDV: crossing a wide river, youths of the pack Ofgufo discover the continent Appaleb. They call it Fych Sakayb, meaning 'leaf land'.

6.33 million BDV: fleeing pursuers, hunters of the band Sytkos discover the continent Bim. They call it Evshew Kar, meaning 'where the lightning runs'.

4.68 million BDV: looking for a better hunting ground, youths of the band Tatha discover the continent Irchet. They call it Thebosych Sinbos, meaning 'where plants and fish bash'.

19359 BDV, in Irchet: The Chouth tribe notice that mango plants have grown where they dropped seeds last year.

They decide to settle down and farm the land (a few years later, after figuring out just what farming is).

This town comes to be known as Dewu.

Soon, other towns are formed as the secret of agriculture spreads.
