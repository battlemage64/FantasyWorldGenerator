# FantasyWorldGenerator
A generator I'm writing as my first public project. Note that the description is inaccurate in that the program isn't finished yet and therefore doesn't do what it says fully (or at all, sometimes).

This program generates a map of a (fictional) world, complete with lakes, rivers, biomes, cities, and countries. It also generates a history of human civilization to go along with it and a navigable timeline. Essentially, it's a "world generator." If you want to set a book or game in a fictional world but are stuck for ideas, or just want to get a cool-looking map, fire this program up!

# Special Thanks
to David Stark, creator of Airships: Conquer the Skies (a fantastic video game, play it!) for sharing his map-generation algorithm, which forms the basis for the continent shapes.
