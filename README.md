# FantasyWorldGenerator
A fantasy world map generator I wrote as my first public project. Features several different ways to generate an island terrain map, as well as several tools for writing a procedurally-generated history.

Currently not in active development.

# Special Thanks
to David Stark, creator of Airships: Conquer the Skies (a fantastic video game, play it!) for sharing his map-generation algorithm, which forms the basis for the continent shapes.
